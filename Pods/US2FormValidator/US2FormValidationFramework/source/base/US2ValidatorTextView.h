#pragma mark - Validator text view interface

/**
 The validator text view is the central object to use. It inherits UITextView and listens internally
 to all own changes. After every change it validates the changed text material. When a validator, which
 was added to the validator text view, reports a violation the validatorTextViewDelegate will be 
 served with this information. The validatorTextViewDelegate is of type US2ValidatorTextViewDelegate
 and returns what went wrong and in which status the validation text field is at the moment.
